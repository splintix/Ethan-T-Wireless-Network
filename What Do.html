<p style="font-size: 28px; color: white;"> A wireless network does the same job as a wired network
but their differences matter. A wireless network provides internet to a designated area without having
to connect cables or wires to devices to provide internet access. A wireless network can be accessed by
using a password given by an internet provider instead of using wires or cables. A wireless network
broadcasts a signal in which computers or devices can detect and join. Wireless networks make life
easier for people as there would not be any connection problems if someone moved around. Wireless networks
are proven to be more popular than wired networks as the wireless networks is less troubling and is less
costly to install.</p>
