<p style="font-size: 28px; color: white;"> Wireless networks are very important to society as we heavily
  rely on technology to assist or carry out tasks for us. The reason why wireless networks are important
   in our everyday lives is that wireless is cheap and affordable for companies, businesses and homes rather
   than using wired networks which are way more expensive. Technology is often changing which can result in
   cables being added or removed every time there is a change within the business or home.
   Using wireless networks can avoid the costly process of installing wired networks, internet problems when
    moving around and changing. It is convenient for meetings since wireless networks are easy to access.
    since there arenâ€™t any cables that need to be connected to your device whereas having a wired network can
    limit your movement since you need to bring the cables with you wherever you go since the cables have to
    be constantly connected to the device in order to work or operate correctly. </p>
